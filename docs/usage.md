# Usage


### Restarting
After changing configuration files, the changes will need to be loaded.  Changes
are loaded by restarting the server, but sometimes partial restart can be done
if only certain modules were affected.

In the web UI, navigating to `Configuration` > `General` will bring up the right
page.  Here, certain reload options may make sense depending on what was
changed.  If not applicable, though, or when it doubt (and definitely if
`configuration.yaml` changed), the `Restart` at the bottom for the server
management will be required.
